I've been working in the oil & gas industry for the last 3 years, albeit more on the tech side which is more transferable. It's been a great challenge and learning experience but it was never meant to be forever and the major challenges have been solved. I've been looking at getting into the defense industry for a while but am uncertain about what are the most important and sought-after skills.

I started looking at defense-related jobs that allow me to use my broad-ranging skillset in mechanical, software, and a lesser extent electrical engineering. If you search "defense" on LinkedIn, you get roles such as systems, product, program, solution, design, test, or RF engineers. Most of these roles would allow me to use the cross-disciplines skills I've gained; I definitely don't qualify for RF roles, that's pure electrical but it's something I've always found interesting after developing a RFID tracking system to install on offshore drillships.
