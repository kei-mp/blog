The blog post graph on the homepage is a force-directed graph using the [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force) javascript library. I don't personnaly use Obisidian for note-taking (however I believe a lot of developers use it to try feel productive and end up spending more time creating the perfect productivity system instead of being productive - see my post on [productivity systems should be like SubWay](./subway))
