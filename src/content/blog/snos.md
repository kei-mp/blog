I was going to write about how microservices are technical debt, but that's an obvious fact that people get weirdly upset about. By technical debt, I mean that you should only use them if you have a good reason to do so. No, scaling is not a good reason, monoliths can scale[^foot]. The deeper issue is the shiny new object syndrome, and I think that's a harder problem to solve.

[^foot]: Unless you're Google or Amazon scale, in which case you probably already know what you're doing and aren't reading this blog post.
