<p style>This is part of a series for building an encoderless mini 2-wheel robot:</p>

1. <a href="/proj/bemf-1-intro/">Introduction & Problem Description</a>
2. Model Identification and Control
3. Experimentation & Testing
4. Building a Prototype
5. Designing & building a Custom PCB

In any control systems problem, there are essentially two parts:

1. Model Identification, or designing the mathematical model and requirements of the system.
2. Model Control, or designing the required controls for the system.
