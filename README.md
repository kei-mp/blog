# My Personal Blog

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my personal blog. Here, I share my thoughts, learnings, and projects, diving into basically everything and anything that sparks my curiosity. My primary aim is to showcase my web-development skills and build a portfolio for my electro-mechanical and system design work, giving you a glimpse into my thought process. Beyond that, it's a handy reference for sharing interesting content and a logbook for important career lessons, both for my future self and to share openly.

## Sneak Peek

Here's a look at the blog:

## Tech Stack

Built with a focus on maintainability since I'm not a very active writer:

* **Astro.js:** A modern static site builder that allows for incredibly fast websites by shipping zero JavaScript by default. Perfect for a content-focused site like this.
* **Vue.js:** Used specifically for the interactive graph featured on the home page. Vue provides the reactivity needed for the data visualization without adding overhead to the rest of the static content.

## Want to Know More?

If you want to learn more about me, my background, or my development philosophy (which as you can see, leans towards simplicity), check out the the [About page](https://kei-p.net/about/) on the blog.

Leave an issue on this repo if you'd like to talk about anything, thanks for stopping by.
